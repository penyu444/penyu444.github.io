        <br><h1>Introduction
        </h1><br>
        <p>Hello my name is Moh. Rakha Iqbal Bareno im from Cirebon city. and i take a little bit of pride 
            about where im from because i think Cirebon is inherintely a quite unique city

            i love animating and drawing you can feel free see my past work on the Gallery
            the gallery is the main course of the website, its divided into 3 section Illustration, Animation, and Games
        </p><br>
        <h1>My expertise
        </h1><br>
        <p>I always took an interest in Creative works ever since i was a little baby. I love drawing and
            watching cartoons and animation. and ive just sharpening and honing my skills ever since then.
            personally my journey learning art and animation is the path that i walk alone. there are others
            that do animation and art that are my friends. but i rarely talk to them about drawing instead just
            normal conversation, dont know why its like that but it is what it is.

            the software that i use most of the time is CLIP STUDIO PAINT, Opentoonz, Asprite. there are other
            software that i use i forgot the name about, but thats because i always open minded to change software
            if there are better option because the software that i use is not that great, maybe i could use blender
            grease pencil in the future or adobe after effects.
